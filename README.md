# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Requirements:

1. There should be a like button:

The content of the like button should be in the following format: "Like | 100", where 100 is the total number of likes.
It should have a "like-button" class.
Wrap the number of likes in a span with a "likes-counter" class.
The initial number of likes in the counter should be 100.

2. Users can add a like. By clicking the button:

The number of likes should increase by one.
Like button should have "liked" class in addition to the "like-button" class (you can use the classnames tool for that).

3. Users can undo their like by clicking again on the button. The counter should decrease by one.
   "liked" class should be removed.

Assessment/Tools:
Only two imports are allowed: react (v16.8.6) and classnames (v2.2.5). Both are at the top of the starting code.
Use the animation below as a reference for your solution.
Design/styling is not assessed and will not affect the score. You should focus only on implementing the requirements.
The "Preview" tab will display your component. You can use it for testing purposes.
